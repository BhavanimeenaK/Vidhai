# Vidhai

Vidhai is a collaborative initiative to identify, collect and create datasets for Tamil. Our objective is to enable and promote cutting edge AI research in Tamil by building foundation models and tools for native speakers of Tamil globally. 

## Contributing to Vidhai
Everyone can join and contribute to this initiative between _1st March 2024_ and _31 August 2024_. If youâ€™re able to contribute in a qualitative way according to our guidelines, you stand a chance to win some SWAGS, and become a co-author of our upcoming paper. Primary language of contribution is Tamil but we will also accept bilingual datasets aimed at specific tasks if the quality is good.

Following are the current tasks that we have identified for contribution (the list will be expanded before the start of the initiative):

### Task 1: Submitting metadata for existing public datasets
You can submit detailed metadata for existing datasets through [this form](https://forms.gle/27MiJrjdzjQ3Qjwe9). You will provide important information such as data source, task, domain, size, annotation method, and so on. You can see more information on metadata here. The list of approved datasets will be made public. 


#### Task 1.1: Fixing quality issues in existing datasets: 
Additionally, you can also submit an entry if you have fixed quality issues in an existing Tamil dataset. For example, removing other language words, unwanted links or references from a scraped Tamil dataset. If you refine an existing dataset, then your entry will be considered as a new dataset. Please add the entry through [this form](https://forms.gle/XnGCFn29AiJsUcGT7)).

### Task 2: Creating new datasets 
You can propose to create a new dataset that can enable further research in various domains, for different tasks and use cases. Upon submission of a [proposal form](https://forms.gle/uprWQiwEGzoDKwLq5) our team will reach out to you to discuss the details. 

## Thank you! 
We greatly appreciate your help! Please refer to this section for your contribution rewards for helping AI-Tamil Nadu. We recognize that some datasets require more effort than others, so please reach out if you have questions. Our goal is to be inclusive with credit!

Our initiative is inspired by [NusaCrowd](https://github.com/IndoNLP/nusa-crowd) and [SEACrowd](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub) which provide open access data to 100+ Indonesian NLP corpora and South East Asian languages NLP corpora respectively. We have adapted the framework to our specific needs.
